# ANTIKAIROS DIGISCORE
<h1> Setup Guide</h1>

The digiscore for ANTIKAIROS is one application with 2 parts - a web server (a computer running the application) and an arbitrary number of clients (tablets, phones, laptops etc. using their web browsers to view the score)

To get set-up, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure all the devices are on the same network. This could all be on wifi, but a wired connection for the server 

2. Open the app on the server computer. 

3. When the application opens, it will note the web address needed to connect in the top left hand corner. Note this down.
