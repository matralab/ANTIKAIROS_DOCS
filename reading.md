Performer View displays the current and upcoming score fragment & repetitions to be played, with a button to turn the page when the performer is ready. Below the repetitions a count-down timer displays the ammount of time remaining to play the fragment plus a 13 second grace period. When this counter reaches zero, the page is automatically turned.

Sections can be started by tapping the associated letter.

Conductor View displays all current fragments, and provides the ability to stop and start the performance countdown of all musicians. Sections can be started by tapping the associated letter.
