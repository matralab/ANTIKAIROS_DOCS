The digiscore for AntiKairos has two views - Performer and Conductor View. <br>

Performer View displays the current and upcoming score fragment & repetitions to be played, with a button to turn the page when the performer is ready. Below the repetitions a on the left hand side count-down timer displays the ammount of time remaining to play the fragment plus a 13 second grace period. When this counter reaches zero, the page is automatically turned. When a page is turned, the performer has 4 seconds to read the new score fragment, tempo and repitions. This 4 second countdown is displayed - start playing when the "play now" message is displayed.

Sections can be started by tapping the associated letter. The counter on the right hand side represents the ammount of time left in a section. When this reaches 0, the next section is triggered. When a new section is triggered, new score fragments are generated automatically.

Conductor View displays all current fragments, and provides the ability to stop and start the performance countdown of all musicians. Sections can be started by tapping the associated letter.
